## Things that would be useful for a tester to know;
1. Where he can get the build from
1. the changes that were made and what to look out for
1. how to create an issue ticket properly in Github

## Where to find the latest build
You can find all new builds under the relase section in Github. 

1. First we need to head to the main page of our [Github](https://github.com/PhillypHenning/2D-Platformer-Template) 
1. On the right there is a panel with entries like; `About`, `Releases` and `Packages`. Click on `tags` under the `Releases` section, this will bring you to a complete history of our project builds. 
1. Click on the top most tag
1. Download any of the builds that are listed under `Assets`

## Where is the Changelog
The changelog will contain all recently made changes that the developers need some help keeping an eye on. 

The changelog can be found in this project in the folder; `Doc/Changelog/`.

Changelogs have dates on them, however there will always be a `master-changelog` with all unconfirmed changes from the developers. It is recommended you look review the `master-changelog` document instead of the individual ones. 

## How to create an issue ticket for the developers
1. First we need to head to the main page of our [Github](https://github.com/PhillypHenning/2D-Platformer-Template) 
1. Above the main middle section on the top left click on `Issues`
1. On the right click on `New Issue`
1. Give the issue you've found a name and write a short summary of what you did to find it. The more info the better but we have discord to chat if we need to. 
1. On the right panel select `Labels` and apply a relevant tag, we recommend `Bug`.
